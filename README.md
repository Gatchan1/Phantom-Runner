# Phantom Runner
Small and fun javascript game rendered on a canvas.

This project was started as a team effort along with other two team members (Toni and Pedro), during an intensive 9-week Ironhack Web Development bootcamp.
The main idea for the game was mine, my team mates liked it a lot and we started working enthusiastically. I have to say that almost all of the code was mine in the original repo, and this fork is much more structured and polished than the original.

Please check it out!
