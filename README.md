# Phantom Runner
Small and fun javascript game rendered on a canvas.

This project was started as a team effort along with other two team members (Toni and Pedro), during an intensive 9-week Ironhack Web Development bootcamp.
The main idea for the game was mine, my team mates liked it a lot and we started working enthusiastically. I have to say that most of the code in the original repo was mine, and this fork is much more structured and polished than the original.

Please check it out!
